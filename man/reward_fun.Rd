\arguments{
\item{episimdata}{A data frame containing epidemic simulation data.}

\item{alpha}{A penalty factor for case prediction errors.}

\item{ovp}{A penalty value applied if the predicted cases exceed a certain threshold.}

\item{C_target}{The target number of cases for the given day.}

\item{C_target_pen}{The case threshold above which the penalty `ovp` is applied.}

\item{R_target}{The target effective reproduction number.}

\item{actions}{A matrix containing intervention actions, with a column specifying the cost of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI).}

\item{ii}{The current time step in the simulation.}

\item{jj}{The index of the action scenario being evaluated.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the reward for the given time step.
}
\description{
This function calculates the reward based on case prediction errors, reproduction number deviation, and intervention costs.
}
\details{
The function computes the absolute error between predicted and target cases (`C_err_pred`) and the deviation of the reproduction number (`R_err_pred`). If the predicted cases exceed `C_target_pen`, an additional penalty (`ovp`) is applied. The final reward incorporates these penalties along with the intervention cost.
