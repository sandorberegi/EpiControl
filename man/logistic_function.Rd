\title{Logistic Function for Transition Between Reproduction Numbers}
\usage{
logistic_function(t, R0, R1, r, t0)
}
\arguments{
\item{t}{A numeric value or vector representing the time point(s) at which to calculate the reproduction number.}

\item{R0}{A numeric value representing the initial reproduction number (\eqn{R_0}).}

\item{R1}{A numeric value representing the final reproduction number (\eqn{R_1}).}

\item{r}{A numeric value representing the growth rate or steepness of the logistic transition.}

\item{t0}{A numeric value representing the midpoint of the transition where the reproduction number is halfway between \eqn{R_0} and \eqn{R_1}.}
}
\value{
A numeric value or vector representing the reproduction number at each time point in \code{t}.
}
\description{
This function models a smooth transition between two reproduction numbers (\eqn{R_0} and \eqn{R_1})
over time using a logistic curve.
}
\details{
The function computes the reproduction number using the logistic equation:
\deqn{R(t) = \frac{R_1 - R_0}{1 + \exp(-r \cdot (t - t_0))} + R_0}

This models a smooth, sigmoidal transition from \eqn{R_0} to \eqn{R_1} over time.
}
\examples{
# Transition from R0 = 2.5 to R1 = 1.0 over time
times <- seq(0, 10, by = 0.1)
reproduction_numbers <- logistic_function(times, R0 = 2.5, R1 = 1.0, r = 0.5, t0 = 5)
plot(times, reproduction_numbers, type = "l", main = "Logistic Transition of Reproduction Number")
